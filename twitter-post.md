# Twitter Post for Anurag Dey

## Simple Twitter Post:

ðŸš€ Just tested the @Keploy Chrome Extension and I'm blown away! 

As an AI/ML enthusiast, I've been looking for smarter ways to test APIs. This tool captured 55+ GitHub APIs and 90KB of Reddit interactions automatically - all by just browsing naturally!

No more manual API discovery. No more synthetic test data. Just real-world API patterns captured intelligently.

The future of API testing is AI-powered! ðŸ¤–
