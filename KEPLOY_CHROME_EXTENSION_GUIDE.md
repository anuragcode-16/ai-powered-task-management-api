# From Manual API Testing to AI-Powered Automation: My Journey with Keploy Chrome Extension

## Introduction
Today I explored the Keploy Chrome Extension as part of Session 4 of the API Fellowship program. This tool promises to revolutionize how we test APIs by automatically capturing real-world API calls from websites and generating comprehensive test suites.

## The Challenge
Traditional API testing requires:
- Manual endpoint discovery
- Writing test cases from scratch
- Maintaining test suites as APIs evolve
- Understanding complex authentication flows

## The Solution: Keploy Chrome Extension
The extension automatically:
- Captures live API calls while browsing
- Generates test cases with real request/response data
- Provides cURL commands for immediate testing
- Offers insights into API behavior patterns

## Testing Experience

### Website 1: [Website Name]
I tested [website] and discovered [number] different API endpoints, including:
- [Key API 1]: Used for [purpose]
- [Key API 2]: Handles [functionality]

**Surprising Discovery**: [Share something unexpected you learned]

### Website 2: [Website Name]
On [second website], the extension captured [number] API calls, revealing:
- [Interesting pattern 1]
- [Authentication method used]
- [Performance characteristics]

## Key Insights

### What I Loved
1. **Zero Setup**: No configuration needed, just install and start recording
2. **Real-world Data**: Captures actual API calls with real payloads
3. **Instant Results**: Immediate access to cURL commands and test cases
4. **Learning Tool**: Great for understanding how modern web apps work

### Challenges Faced
1. [Any difficulty you encountered]
2. [How you solved it]
3. [Suggestions for improvement]

## Manual vs AI-Powered Testing

### Before Keploy

- ‚úçÔ∏è Writing tests from scratch
- üêõ Missing edge cases

### With Keploy
- ‚ö° Instant API discovery
- ü§ñ AI-generated test cases
- üìä Real-world data patterns
- üéØ Comprehensive coverage

## The Future of API Testing
This experience showed me that AI-powered testing tools like Keploy are not just convenient‚Äîthey're necessary for modern development. The ability to instantly understand and test any API by simply browsing a website is game-changing.

## Conclusion
Going from 0 to 100% API test coverage in minutes instead of hours is transformative. The Keploy Chrome Extension democratizes API testing, making it accessible to developers, QA engineers, and anyone curious about how the web works.

### Next Steps
